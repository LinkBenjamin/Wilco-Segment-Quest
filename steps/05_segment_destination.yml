learningObjectives: 
- Learn how to connect source to destination in Segment

hints:
- "To connect a destination to your Segment workspace, look in Connections and choose 'Destinations' from your Segment workspace menu."
- "Segment asks for an API Key and an Account Secret.  You can find them on the Project Settings menu of your Mixpanel account."
- "Make sure you activate the destination in Segment, or the data won't flow to it!"
- "You can use the Event Delivery dashboard in Segment (located inside the Destination) to see whether events are flowing."
- "Look on the Events tab in Mixpanel to see whether they're received."

      - text: "A destination is a place where you can send your data, like Google Analytics, Amplitude, or Mixpanel. You can even use simple serverless function as a destination and host it directly within a paid Segment plan."
      - text: "For our purposes today, we're going to connect the site to Mixpanel. If you don't already have one, request a [free account](https://mixpanel.com/register/) on Mixpanel's site."
